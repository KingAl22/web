<dt> <h2> what is the web? </h2> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A web is a conection of html
    and other references that
    refer to each other with links
    </p>
</dd>

<dt>
  <h2>
  WHAT IS THE MEANING OF HTML ?
</h2>
 </dt>
<dd>
  HTML means <strong><em>HyperText Markup
  Lanuguage</em></strong>.<br>
  <mark>HyperText</mark> is about references and links
  i.e they are texts that can have references and links
  to other documents and resourses.<br>
  <mark>HTML is the language that
    provides the structure
    and text of web pages.</mark>
</dd>

<dt>
  <h2>
    WHAT IS THE MEANING OF HTTP?
  </h2>
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  HTTP means <strong> Hypertext Transfer
     Protocol </strong> <br>
  These are the rules that guide how request works
  between a web browser and a server.<br>
  There are two types of <strong>http</strong>
  addresses, there is;
  <ul>
    <li> <em>HTTP</em>
    <li> <em>HTTPS</em>.
  </ul>
  The difference between addresses with
  <em>http</em> and <em>https</em>
  is whether the browser uses encryption to
  keep your data protected,
   <ul>
     <li>(the <b>S</b> stands
     for secure).
   </ul>

<h3>Concepts to understand  during programming</h3>
</dt>
<dd>   <ol>
     <li>
         <strong>SYNTAX: </strong>
     Grammer rules of any Lanuguage.

    <li>
      <strong>FORMALISM: </strong> The computer
       will read and understand everything as it sees it,
       there is no autocorrect and all errors
       must be corrected manually.
    <li>
         <strong>NESTING: </strong> It has to do with how some bits of codes can go inside
            other bits of code in an orderly way.

   <li>
         <strong>THERE IS ALOT OF HELP AVAILABLE FOR BEGINNERS EVERYWHERE,</strong>
           do not be afraid to ask questions and always document your works.
     </ol> </dd>

<dt> <h3>The job of HTML</h3> </dt>
    <dd>
       HTML documents are the building blocks of the web,
    they are made up of;
    <ul>
      <li> <em>Text</em> (that the user will usually read
      in their browsers)
      <li><em>Markup </em> (this tells the browser what the text
     should look like or how they are arranged and within <mark> <em> Markup </em> </mark>)
     there can be references to include other documents and files like images and videos
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

   <dt> <h3> MARKUP </h3> </dt>
   <dd>
     Markup can be described as text with special meaning or function some special functions, <br>
     these texts are enclosed in < > and this makes them perform their special functions.
     the Markup texts are called <strong> Tags </strong> (opening tags < >, and closing tags < / >). <br>
     An element is the combination of the opening and closing tags with some texts in between them.
   </dd>

   <dt>    <h3>BREAKS AND EMPTY ELEMENTS</h3> </dt>
<dd>  <mark> Whitespace </mark> is a word that programmers use to talk about spaces,tabs and linebreaks,
 when you render an html file on a browser, the browser by default renders all Whitespace as a single space character.<br>
 In order to create linebreaks that will show in the browser, we use the <strong>br</strong> tag. <br>
 <strong>br</strong> tag is called a <strong>VOID/EMPTY ELEMENTS</strong>. <br>
 There are lots of elements;
 <ul>
   <li> mark / mark used for highlighting
   <li> sub /sub used for subscripting i.e making text appear lower than other.
   <li> sup /sup used for superscripting i.e making text appear higher than others
 </ul>
</dd>

<dt> <h3>NESTED ELEMENTS</h3> </dt>
   <dd> This is the decision to put a tag inside another one.<br>
   one nesting rule is that <q> tags do not overlap each other </q>,
   you close each tag accordingly.<br>
   example; <ul>
     <li> <em> hello <mark> kelly! </mark>  </em>
   </ul>
 </dd>
   <dt> <h3>BLOCK AND INLINE</h3> </dt>
  <dd> Block elements are elements that create like an invisible box around the text.<br>
  some example of block elements are;
  <ul>
    <li> paragraph(p) tag
    <li> lists(ol and ul) tags
    <li> headline(h1,h2), etc.
    </ul>
  Elements that don't create a box and are used in between the sentence
  and do not create any box around the text, they are called inline elements.<br>
  example of inline elements are;
  <ul>
    <li> linebreak(br)
    <li> emphasis(em, strong)
    <li> highlighting(mark)
    <li> hypertext link(a), etc.
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>  <h3>THE DIV ELEMENT</h3> </dt>
  <dd> the div is short for division because it can be used to divide up the pages into different sections.<br>
  The p(paragraph) element is specifically meant to contain text, <br>
  in contrast, the div element is generic container for whatever other elements you might want to put inisde.<br>
  You can the the div element to organise the content and divide the pages into sections.
</dd>

   <dt>  <h3>LISTS & IMPLIED CLOSE TAGS</h3> </dt>
  <dd>  There are some elements that cannot stand on their own. <br>
   <strong> li </strong> - is one item on the list <br>
   There are 2 different kinds of lists that an (li) can be part of:<br>
   <ol>
     <li>ordered list (ol)</li>
     <li>unordered list (ul)</li>
   </ol>
   The li element can only occur inside an ol and ul element.<br>
   the li element has an optional closing tag, i.e it can function properly with only the opening tag.<br>
   The ol and ul elements are used to make nested lists.
 </dd>

<dt>  <h3> NESTED LIST </h3> </dt>
  <dd>
    A nested list is a list that contain the ul and ol tags, it is used to creat lists within another list.<br>
    An example below:
    <ol>
      <li> MAMMALS
        <ul>
          <li>Gorillas
          <li>Racoons
        </ul>
      <li> REPTILES
        <ul>
          <li>Cobras
          <li>Iguanas
        </ul>
        <li> BIRDS
        <ul>
          <li>Ravens<
          <li>Ostriches
        </ul>
    </ol>
   </dd>
  <dt> <h3> WEB ADDRESS</h3></dt>
   <dd>  The web is made up of web addresses and these addresses tell your browser how to locate resourses.<br>
    A web address is called a URL, where;
    <ul>
      <li> U - Uniform = Standardlized
      <li> R - Resource = a file or other data object
      <li> L - Locator = address for finding something
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples of URL could be; <br>
        http://en.wikipedia.org/ <br>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/ <br>
        file:///user/DESKTOP/ALERT
      </p>
      There are URLs which are called absolute URL or fully qualified URLs.
      these URLs spell out all the information required to locate a resource.<br>
      A URL has 3 paths,(Protocol, Domain and file path).
      <ul>
        <li> Protocol (Http, Https, File).
        <li> Domain (en.wikipedia).
        <li> File Path (Follows after the domain but is usually left blank).
            </ul>
       </dd>

<dt>
<h3>LINKS AND a TAGS</h3>
 </dt>
        <dd>
          the <code> &lt a &gt </code>  tag is used to make links in html,
          <code> &lt a &gt </code>is called an anchor. <br>
          The <code> < a > </code> cannot be used alone, the opening tag must contain attributes and the text
          that the user will click on.<br>
          <h4>example of a link</h4>
          <a href="http://www.google.com" target = "_blank">google
          </a> <br>br
          the above link when clicked, opens up a tab directly to the google site.
        </dd>
           <dt>
<h3>LINK PARTS BREAKDOWN</h3>
           </dt>
           <dd>  <ul>
              <li> <code> (href = "http://www.google.com") </code>: This is called an ATTRIBUTE.
              <li> <code> (href) </code>: This is called Name of the ATTRIBUTE.
              <li> <code> (http://www.google.com) </code>: This is called the Value of ATTRIBUTE.
              <li> <code> (Google) </code>:This is known as the Link Text.
            </ul>
            NOTE: ATTRIBUTE LIKE <b> href </b> ONLY GO TO THE OPENING TAG AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ELEMENT.
           </dd>
          <dt> <h3>ADDING IMAGES</h3> </dt>
        <dd>
          img is the element used to add images to html code.<br>
          The img uses two attributes;
          <ul>
            <li>"src" also called source, this is the URL of the image file.<br>
              it tells the browser where to get the image from.
            <li> "alt" also called alternate, this is the text description of the image.<br>
              it tells the browser what to display in case an image does not show.
          </ul>
          the img element is a void element, it does not need a closing tag,it is also an inline element.
          <h5>examples of img elements</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/1200px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="html">
            <li><img src="al.jpg" alt="AL">
          </ol>
        </dd>

           <dt> <h3>IMAGES AS LINKS</h3> </dt>
           <dd>
             In order to create an image as a link, we put the img element between the open and close tags of an anchor element.<br>
             for example:<br>
             <a href="https://www.google.com" target ="_blank"><img src="al.jpg" alt="google"></a>
             this is an example of nesting.
            </dd>
           <dt> <h3>Files and Relatives URLs</h3> </dt>
           <dd>
             Relatives URLs are used to fetch files in one's own computer directory, there is no need to add <b>http://</b>,<br>
             absolute URLs are used to link the html to other sites, <b>http://</b> will make any link absolute.<br>
             Example:<br>
             <a href="https://placebear.com/800/600" target="_blank"> bears</a><br>
             NOTE: <mark> target="_blank" </mark> will open the link in a new tab, if not the link will open in the workplace.
           </dd>
